  <h1>🌍 What is Gravity?</h1>

<p1>Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that pulls objects with mass toward each other. It’s why:

Things fall to the ground when dropped.

The Earth orbits the Sun.

The Moon orbits the Earth.

You feel “weight” on Earth.

📜 History of Gravity
1. Isaac Newton (1600s)

Newton described gravity as an invisible force of attraction between two masses.

He gave the formula:

𝐹
=
𝐺
𝑚
1
𝑚
2
𝑟
2
F=G
r
2
m
1
	​

m
2
	​

	​


where:

𝐹
F = force of gravity

𝐺
G = gravitational constant

𝑚
1
,
𝑚
2
m
1
	​

,m
2
	​

 = masses of two objects

𝑟
r = distance between them

Example: The Earth pulls the apple down, and the apple also pulls the Earth up (but Earth is too massive to notice).

2. Albert Einstein (1905–1915)

Einstein explained gravity with his Theory of General Relativity.

He said: gravity isn’t just a force—it’s the curvature of space-time caused by mass.

Heavy objects (like planets or stars) bend space-time, and smaller objects move along these curves.

⚡ Effects of Gravity

On Earth

Keeps air and water around us.

Causes tides (Moon’s gravity pulls Earth’s oceans).

Determines your weight (your mass × Earth’s gravity).

In the Solar System

Keeps planets orbiting the Sun.

Controls movement of asteroids, moons, and comets.

In the Universe

Holds galaxies together.

Creates black holes (regions where gravity is so strong, not even light can escape).

Shapes stars and planets during their formation.

📏 Strength of Gravity

Gravity is the weakest force in nature (weaker than electromagnetism, nuclear forces), but it acts over infinite distances.

Depends on two things:

Mass of the objects (more mass = stronger pull).

Distance between them (closer = stronger).

🌌 Interesting Facts

Your weight on the Moon is 1/6th of your weight on Earth.

Astronauts in space feel weightless because they are in free fall around Earth.

Black holes have such intense gravity that time slows down near them.

✅ In simple words:
Gravity is the invisible glue of the universe. It keeps your feet on the ground, makes planets orbit the Sun, and even decides how stars live and die. Without gravity, there would be no Earth, no Sun, no galaxies—just scattered particles floating in emptiness.</p1>
